## Info

At the moment the game tends to freeze or just simply stop at random locations. Sadly we could not fix this error until now.
We assume that the error happens due to our Threads, since they sometimes overlap or just stop.
But since we are using so many Threads, it's difficult to determine, what the exact problem is.

If you do experience that error, a quick restart fixes the problem. 
Unfortunately all the progress will be lost, so we hope and pray that you won't have to deal with this error!:)

Good luck and have fun!!

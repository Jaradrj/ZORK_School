                You don't hesitate and grab the note with the
                police's number out of your backpack. Calling now...
                
                Congratulations. You made it out. Alive.
                You called the police. You exposed the hidden doors. You told them everything.
                And for a while, it felt like justice would follow.
                But truth is rarely as simple as it seems.
                And survival doesn’t always mean freedom.
                
                Your school was known for excellence.
                A hub for “gifted youth,” praised for its scientific achievements and quietly pressured to produce results.
                Behind the high grades and smiling faculty hid something else:
                MindScale — a covert neuropsychological experiment disguised as a student performance program.
                
                It started small.
                Extra lessons. Secret “research initiatives.” Voluntary participation.
                Until it wasn’t voluntary anymore.
                
                Klara Price was the poster child.
                Top of her class. Always polite. Always ready to please.
                She wasn’t chosen randomly.
                She was conditioned. By praise, by pressure, and by Mrs. Hamps, the school psychologist.
                Hamps told her she was special. That her talent could change the world.
                All Klara had to do was help test a new compound:
                Scopolamine, a neurotoxin that suppresses resistance, enhances suggestibility, and erodes memory.
                
                Klara didn’t ask why.
                By the time she realized what was happening, it was too late.
                Her silence helped perfect a drug that killed her classmates
                and in the end, where she could hardly stay silent anymore, even herself.
                Her loyalty was her downfall.
                
                Leandro wasn’t like Klara.
                He questioned authority. Refused to play along. Noticed the missing students.
                They said he dropped out.
                But the truth? He became a liability. And liabilities were added to the test pool.
                Leandro resisted the drug. Fought the effects.
                But resistance wasn’t enough. His name was erased. His body hidden.
                He died trying to find the truth.

                Toby McConnor worked at the school for 30 years.
                He wasn’t a genius. He wasn’t on any list. He was just… observant.
                When he heard strange noises in the electrical room, he followed them.
                He crawled through a maintenance shaft, left unlocked by accident.
                They never meant for anyone to find the room.
                Especially not Toby.
                His name never made the papers. He was just “an unfortunate workplace accident.”
                
                Mrs. Hamps was supposed to protect students.
                Instead, she led the project.
                MindScale wasn’t her idea, but she executed it perfectly.
                Students deemed “emotionally unstable” or “underperforming” were marked for trials.
                They weren’t expected to survive.
                They were expected to comply.
                The experiment spiraled.
                Overdoses. Hallucinations. Deaths.
                But even then, she continued. "For the greater good."
                They say she broke down when arrested.
                But some claim she simply smiled.
                
                After your escape, the police launched an investigation.
                Hamps and three others were arrested. The school board denied knowledge.
                New programs were introduced.
                "Wellness initiatives."
                "Trauma-informed learning environments."
                But behind new posters and smiling counselors, the structure remained unchanged.
                
                Weeks later, a letter arrives at your home. No return address.
                
                Inside:
                    “Participant #27: Conclusion successful. Resistance indicates independent cognition. Memory retention: 97%. Recommendation: Proceed to Phase II.”
                
                You realize the truth.
                You weren’t the one who escaped the system.
                You were the final subject.
                
                Everything, the missing students, the clues, even your escape, it was all orchestrated.
                A test of your limits. Of your morality. Of your mind.
                
                The project never failed.
                It evolved.
                You believed you were fighting the system.
                But you were inside it the whole time.
                And if even you couldn’t tell what was real…
                how many others still think they’re awake?
                
                THE END.

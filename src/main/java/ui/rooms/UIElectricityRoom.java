                    You look inside, but all you see is darkness.
                    And so it's clear, the only way forward is to jump.
                    You pause, thinking about everything that brought you here.
                    The risks, the choices, the distance you've come. And all
                    that just to turn around and leave?
                    No. Not after all of this. I mean it's just a jump right?
                    You try and climb out of the shaft, barely getting into the
                    right position to just let go and jump.
                    Just a few seconds later, you feel the hard ground beneath
                    your feet. You tried to land upright, but your legs buckle
                    and you drop to your knees with a sharp jolt of pain.
                    They're sore. Nothing broken, but it hurts.
                    You stand up and try to figure out, what you can do.
                    At the far end of the room, a green emergency exit light flickers.
                    Hoping to see something useful, you decide to walk toward it.
                    You manage to take the first few steps, until suddenly,
                    the hard ground meets your knees once more.
                    Out of frustration and the need for light you manage to
                    get up and continue walking, ignoring whatever it was that you stumbled over.
                    You keep walking, step after step, until you finally reach the light.
                    You glance around, and through the dimness, you make out the
                    shape of the reactor and next to it, the exit.
                    While you keep observing your surroundings you notice that
                    weird irony smell once again.
                    You wonder and wonder what it is, but just can't figure it out.
                    It smells like mold and blood or just like death.
                    Then you remember the weird thing you stumbled over earlier.
